# Decentralized Fisheries Management

This repository contains a suite of smart contracts designed to revolutionize fisheries management through blockchain technology. These contracts create a transparent, efficient system for verifying fishing vessels, tracking catches, managing quotas, verifying processing, and certifying sustainable practices.

## Core Components

### Vessel Verification Contract
Validates fishing boats through registration documents, licensing verification, and vessel monitoring system integration. This contract ensures that only authorized vessels can participate in the ecosystem, preventing illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities.

### Catch Tracking Contract
Records comprehensive harvest data including species, quantities, locations, and timestamps. This contract creates an immutable record of all fishing activities from the moment of capture, enabling full traceability throughout the seafood supply chain.

### Quota Management Contract
Enforces sustainable fishing limits through real-time monitoring of catch volumes against allocated quotas. This contract automatically tracks individual and fleet-wide harvests, preventing overfishing through programmable catch limits and seasonal restrictions.

### Processing Verification Contract
Tracks the chain of custody as seafood moves from vessels through processing facilities and distribution channels. This contract ensures that only verified catches enter the legitimate supply chain, preventing the mixing of sustainable and unsustainable products.

### Certification Contract
Validates adherence to sustainable fishing practices through predefined criteria and third-party verification. This contract provides transparent confirmation of environmental standards, creating trusted certifications that consumers and buyers can easily verify.

## Benefits
